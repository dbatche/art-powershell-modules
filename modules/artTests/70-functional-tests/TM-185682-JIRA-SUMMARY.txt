TM-185682: Duplicate Barcode ID with PUT in REST API
TEST RESULTS SUMMARY - October 17, 2025
================================================================================

RESOLUTION: ✅ NOT A BUG - WORKING AS DESIGNED

ISSUE TESTED:
What happens when barcodeId is included in the PUT request body for:
  PUT /orders/{orderId}/details/{orderDetailId}/barcodes/{barcodeId}

TEST RESULTS:
-------------
Test #1: Including same barcodeId in request body as path parameter
  Result: ✅ Update succeeds
  Behavior: API ignores barcodeId field in body
  
Test #2: Including different barcodeId in request body than path parameter  
  Result: ✅ Update succeeds
  Behavior: API ignores barcodeId field in body

CONCLUSION:
-----------
The API demonstrates CORRECT RESTful design:
  • Path parameter defines the resource identity
  • Request body only contains properties to update
  • barcodeId in request body is properly ignored
  • No duplicate errors occur because API uses path parameter only
  
This is the expected and proper behavior for RESTful APIs.

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
✅ Mark ticket as "Working as Designed"
✅ Close ticket - No code changes needed

SEPARATE ISSUE DISCOVERED (Not part of TM-185682):
================================================================================

ISSUE: POST /orders/{orderId}/details/{orderDetailId}/barcodes 
       doesn't save optional field values

SYMPTOMS:
  • POST creates barcode with barcodeId successfully
  • All optional fields (altBarcode1, weight, etc.) default to empty/zero
  • PUT successfully updates values after creation
  
POSSIBLE CAUSES:
  1. By Design: POST creates "skeleton", PUT updates values (two-step workflow)
  2. Business Rules: Certain fields only settable via PUT
  3. Bug: POST should save optional fields but doesn't

RECOMMENDATION:
  • Verify with TM development team if this is expected behavior
  • If bug, create separate Jira ticket
  • If by design, update API documentation to clarify workflow
